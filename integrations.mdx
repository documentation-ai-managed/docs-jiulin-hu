## Webhook Setup

Set up webhooks to receive Jiulin Hu events in external services like Discord or custom dashboards.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Webhook" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your Jiulin Hu dashboard at `https://dashboard.example.com/webhooks`.

    Generate a new webhook URL using this endpoint:

    <CodeGroup tabs="cURL,JavaScript">
    ````bash
    curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/webhooks \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"events": ["test.completed", "test.failed"], "url": "https://your-webhook-url.com/webhook"}'
    ````

    ````javascript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/webhooks', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        events: ['test.completed', 'test.failed'],
        url: 'https://your-webhook-url.com/webhook'
      })
    });
    ````
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Events" icon="settings">
    Select events like `test.completed` or `test.failed`. Jiulin Hu sends payloads with test results, including pass/fail status and logs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Delivery" icon="zap">
    Trigger a test run and verify the webhook receives data. Check headers for `X-JiulinHu-Signature` to validate authenticity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Connections

Connect Jiulin Hu to any service supporting HTTP webhooks or API calls. Use the REST API for custom integrations.

<ParamField path="webhook_id" param-type="string" required="true">
  Unique identifier for the webhook.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="Authorization" param-type="string" required="true">
  Bearer token: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.
</ParamField>

Example payload received on webhook events:

```json
{
  "event": "test.completed",
  "test_id": "tst_abc123",
  "status": "passed",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-15T12:00:00Z",
  "results": {
    "duration": 45,
    "coverage": 95
  }
}
```

## Extending with Plugins

Build or install plugins to add custom test runners or reporters.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js Plugin" icon="nodejs">
    Create a plugin using the Jiulin Hu SDK.

    ````javascript
    const JiulinHu = require('jiulin-hu-sdk');

    class CustomPlugin {
      async run(testSuite) {
        // Custom logic here
        return await JiulinHu.execute(testSuite);
      }
    }

    module.exports = CustomPlugin;
    ````
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python Plugin" icon="python">
    Develop plugins in Python for data-heavy tests.

    ````python
    import jiulin_hu

    class CustomReporter:
        def report(self, results):
            # Process results
            jiulin_hu.send_metrics(results)
            return "success"
    ````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to maintain secure and efficient integrations.

<Expandable title="Secure Your Integrations" default-open="true">
  Always validate webhook signatures using the `X-JiulinHu-Signature` header. Store secrets securely and rotate API keys regularly. Use environment variables for production setups:

  ```bash
  export JIULIN_HU_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
  ```
</Expandable>

<Callout kind="alert">
  Never expose webhook URLs or API keys in public repositories. Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD integrations.
